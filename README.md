# Designing-an-MLR-model-from-SLR-analysis

An algorithm to perform Multiple Linear Regression is developed after analysing effect of every individual independent variable on profit value via Simple Linear Regression. 
A second code that utilises MLR Algorithm of the sklearn library also does the same. 
Outputs of both are also uploaded. One can use the custom MLR algorithm to obtain information on how each independent variable affects the profit value, conduct further changes and tune it to obtain values nearest to actual profit values.
